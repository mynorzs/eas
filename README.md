# eas

eas stands for Etch-a-Sketch

Requirement:
Make a product that creates an initial grid of 16 x 16 divs in which the divs change color when hovering over them. The game has to give the option to the user to create a new grid consisting of a specific length of divs, without changing the pixel dimension. The maximum length allowed should be of 100.

Initial thoughts:
I will try to create the product with what I have learned in The Odin Project, but I will try to add my own content or interactions.

Basic solution thoughts:
I got los in the process and didn't commit the basic version that displayed the inital 16 x 16 grid.
